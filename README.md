Hi there! My name is Jace Yang. 
I am one of the core contributor of the Deloitte INsight, an upcoming financial data product that aims to accelerate data-driven industry analysis, especially analysis deep down the subdivision markets.

This repository is to show my work by mainly pictures and explanations. Although I am not allowed to share the code/source files in public, it may be a way to share them to you by, e.g., sharing some of my preliminary trial. Please email me at yjh.jace@gamil.com if you are interested and want more information.


## My work

Interning for 8 months since the very beginning of the product's R&D period, I have been trusted to take charge of the data division throughout the whole beta stage of this product.

My major contributions here:
- Prototyping the dataflow of the database.
- Building a text classification machine learning baseline.
- Developing a business analytical framework with its data dashboard.
- Designing the web page.

# Data Pipeline

I wrote a SQL-style data processing rundown in R via 100+ tailored function based on dplyr and over 10k+ lines of code. It then helped the team to streamline the workflow and improve the efficiency remarkably.

# Data Dashboard

I research many existing industry analysis framework, and R&D solutions to empower them by bring our unique data on industry segementation.

To give our user (credit company, security, banker...) a functional tools, I built several visualization demo.
